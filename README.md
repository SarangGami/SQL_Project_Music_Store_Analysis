In this project, we analyze a digital music store's data using SQL. The project includes a variety of questions that cover different aspects of the data, ranging from easy to advance level.

**Easy level questions include:**

* Retrieving the senior most employee based on job title
* Identifying the countries with the most invoices
* Finding the top 3 values of total invoice
* Identifying the city with the highest sum of invoice totals
* Identifying the customer who has spent the most money


**Moderate level questions include:**

* Retrieving the email, first name, last name, and genre of all rock music listeners
* Finding the top 10 rock bands by total track count
* Retrieving the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length


**Advanced level questions include:**

* Retrieving the amount spent by each customer on artists
* Finding the most popular music genre for each country
* Identifying the customer that has spent the most on music for each country

**Each question is designed to test your understanding of SQL and data analysis, and to help you gain insights into the digital music store's data. The project is intended as a learning resource for those who are new to SQL and data analysis and as a starting point for those who want to further explore the concepts and techniques used in the project.**
